I'm Chase Adams, a Software Engineering Manager in Las Vegas, NV.

This website is a collection of thoughts about engineering, management and general effectiveness. My goal is to share what I've learned and experienced so that others can learn too.

### [Goorgeous](https://github.com/chaseadamsio/goorgeous)

An Org-mode parser written in Go. It's still in need of a lot of love, but it was written so that I could write content for Hugo in Org syntax.
