# How To Remove the Distraction of Slack

Definition of Slack: not taut or held tightly in position; loose.

When I think of the communications tool "Slack", the _real_ definition of slack is not the first thing that comes to mind...in fact, it's the opposite: I think of "immediacy". If the expecation isn't set that an organization should treat Slack as an asynchoronous tool (asynchronous being "not expecting a response in the next two hours"), it immediately becomes a tool where the expectation is "get to it as soon as it comes in".

I use Slack in the browser instead of installing the client. I set Slack to not send me desktop notifications and to never ask me again if I want to enable desktop notifications.

What it buys me:

- I get to **choose** when I respond to requests
- I can work on work that's in front of me without being interrupted by notifications
