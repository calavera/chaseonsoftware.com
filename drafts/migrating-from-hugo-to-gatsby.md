# Why I Migrated From Hugo to GatsbyJS

- not for build times!!!
- wanted to write react
- wanted server/client side rendering
- like the idea of expanding with plugins rather than contributing to the core

# How I Migrated From Hugo to GatsbyJS

- install the gastby CLI globally (my least favorite part)
- migrated things
