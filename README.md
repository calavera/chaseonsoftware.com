# chaseadams.io

www.chaseadams.io is a statically generated site using GatsbyJS.

## Tasks

- `develop` - run the Gatsby development server. I ran into an issue after upgrading to gatsby@2.x.x where the `hot-update.json` file was timing out, so I followed the recommendation in this [Github issue to pass the host and port](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/864#issuecomment-297744295) explicitly.

## TODO

- Why Gatsby?
- Architecture
- What Plugins Does It Use?
