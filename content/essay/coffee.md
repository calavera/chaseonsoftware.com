It seems a trivial task to share how I make pour over coffee and what I use, but when I started my adventure of learning about coffee, I spent a lot of time digging through the internet to figure out how to do it _right_.

## The "Make Do with What You Have" Man's Pour-Over Coffee

- Measure ~1.5 Tablespoons of beans into the blade Grinder (1.5 is just right for 10 ounces of water for me).
- Pulse the grinder on-and-off again for a 7 Mississippi count.
- Put the dripper ontop of one uncapped Yeti mug and put a single filter in the dripper.
- Pour the ground coffee into the filter and flatten it out with a small divet in the center.
- We don't have a kettle, so I use our filtered hot water and fill a YETI mug almost to the top with enough room to put the lid on.
- Start out by pouring a little water into the center and lightly saturating the top of all the ground, enough that it looks wet, but not enough that there's standing water.
- Once You hear the dripping stop, pour enough water in a clock-wise pattern over the grounds to create a half-inch of standing water.
- Wait until the grounds look like there's no standing water and continue the previous step until there's no more water left to pour out.
- Once the last of your water has filtered through the grounds, take the filter out of the dripper and throw it away.
- Use a spoon to stir the coffee so it's even.
- Enjoy your coffee.

This process usually takes me anywhere between 5-8 minutes. It's a lot of waiting for a single cup of coffee, but I much prefer the taste of it to the Coffee maker.

## Coffees I Enjoy

I'll always choose light or blonde roast, I like the smooth but obvious flavors that come out without being bitter.

- **[Starbucks Veranda](http://www.amazon.com/Starbucks-Veranda-Blend-x2122-Coffee/dp/B006WA2H9Y/ref=sr_1_1_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1459476713&sr=8-1&keywords=starbucks+veranda+bean).** I've most likely lost any street cred I had with anyone who respects coffee at "Blade grinder" and if I didn't, this will be the breaking point, but I really enjoy their blonde roast. It has a smooth taste and I've never made a cup that tasted bitter.
- **[Kicking Horse Three Sisters Blend](http://www.amazon.com/Kicking-Horse-Coffee-Sisters-Medium/dp/B0027Z5J6G/ref=sr_1_3_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1459476752&sr=8-3&keywords=kicking+horse).** For a medium roast, it's also still pretty smooth, but is a little more bold.
- **[Lion Kona Gold Premium 10% Kona Coffee Blend](http://www.amazon.com/Kona-Gold-Premium-Coffee-Blend/dp/B00EZG6URC/ref=sr_1_3_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1459476787&sr=8-3&keywords=lion+kona).** My friend Kevin Sakamoto brought me a bag of this back from Hawaii years ago and it has been, and will continue to be, my favorite coffee.
