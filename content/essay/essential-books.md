Every so often you come across a piece of writing that was such a critical component to changing the way you live your life or pursue work, that it's worth revisiting. 

For myself, I have 3 such books that I re-read multiple times a year and own in multiple formats for consumption.

These books have shaped the man I am today, both in my personal and professional life and without them, I believe I'd be less intentional and less effective.

## The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People

**_by Stephen Covey_**

This book has been with me since I was a teen and I've read it at least once every year (usually at the beginning). If you could only see the spines of the books I keep on the bookshelf, you'd instantly recognize it by its cracks. 

Stephen Covey was the master of being _effective_. The title of the book clears any ambiguity, it's a book about the seven habits that drive highly effective people.

Choosing to intentionally practice these principles has helped me to grow tremendously and every time I read it, I walk away from some new insight because of new experiences I didn't have the year prior.

## Managing Oneself

**_by Peter Drucker_**

Managing Oneself was one of the first books I read after taking a remote position at Walmart Labs. I wanted to know better how I could be a better remote engineer and I read this book because Peter Drucker's work _transcends_ spatial relevance. The principles he lays out in this tiny, essay-esque book were critical for my success as a remote engineer and continue to be critical for my professional growth. 

It was so critical to my success as a remote engineer, I started a [small systematic framework based on Managing Oneself](/systematic/intro).

Because of how easy it is to read and the length, I try to read this every other month in a single sitting.

## Essentialism: The Disciplined Pursuit of Less

**_by Gregory McKeown_**

Essentialism came to me at a time when I craved direction in my career.  

Essentialism is about _living life by *design* not by default._ It's about distinguishing the vital few from the trivial many. It is a systematic approach to determining *what is my highest point of contribution* and *how do I execute on it?*

Essentialism helped me to decide to hone in on the things that were important and eliminate the rest. Every time I read it, it helps me come back to the basics, to determine what's important in this season of life and eliminating the rest.
