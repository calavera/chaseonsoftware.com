I live in Las Vegas, Nevada, daily discovering what it means to live an essential life.

In my day-to-day, I'm focusing on...

- Being present with Jackie (my wife), Elle (my bugaboo), Tag & Belle (our two pups)
- Basking in this glorious season of being a new dad
- Creating tools that allow creatives to build for the web without needing to learn to code at [Webflow](https://webflow.com)
- Reading books
- Writing about distributed teams, productivity and general software practices
- Investing time and energy in helping those around me attain an essential life

I'm incredibly happy where I am in life: watching my little girl experience the newness of life, loving on my wife, learning a ton and building software for fun (and getting paid to do it!).

I try to keep this page updated regularly, so be sure to keep checking back if you're curious what I'm up to!
