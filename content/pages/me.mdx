I'm Chase Adams, a Software Engineer in Las Vegas, NV.

This website is a collection of thoughts about engineering, management and general effectiveness. My goal is to share what I've learned and experienced so that others can learn too.

# What I'm Doing Now

- Loving on my family
- Creating tools that allow creatives to build for the web without needing to learn to code at [Webflow](https://webflow.com)
- Writing articles about Web Development, Management & Distributed Teams
