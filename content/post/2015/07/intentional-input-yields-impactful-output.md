description: "I believe Intentional Input Yields Impactful Output. The core of who I am, what I write about and what I do is wrapped around being intentional about the things, practices and virtues I allow into my life."

"Garbage in, garbage out."

I've always hated that saying.

Don't get me wrong: it's not that I disagree with the concept, I believe that the things, practices and virtues we put into our lives are the very things that shape what we produce. It's an unspoken natural law, really.

My issue is with the nature of the statement itself: that we should focus on the "garbage" and keeping it out of our lives.

So I'm proposing a new mantra for how our daily practices change what we produce:

    Intentional input yields impactful output.

Over the course of the next two weeks, I'm planning on making a concerted effort to make this mantra a deep seated value in my life.
