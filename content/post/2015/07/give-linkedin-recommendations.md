Good will is one of those things you should always want to give and never expect to receive.

Writing LinkedIn Recommendations for people helps them to know what _you_ think they're strong at and gives them a strong endorsement for any future endeavours they may have.

## Keep a Trello Board

I keep a Trello board of the people I want to give recommendations to and keep really good notes through the time I work with people. When I start to get enough information to give a good recommendation, I write it and move it across my Trello board.

## Use It For Peer Reviews
