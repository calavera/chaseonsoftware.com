For just a moment, I want to encourage you to think about someone (the first person to come to mind) who's positively impacted you in the last 5 years in a professional role you've had. Think about what made them stand out, what brought that person to mind?

Now, if you can, try and think of a specific project they worked on. Can you think of something? If so, can you remember the details about that project pertaining to the _work_ they did?

I'm going to go out on a limb and _guess_ that the person who came to mind was someone who invested in people, in growth, in encouragement or someone who had an undeniable ability to bring you out of a slump. They were a bright spot in the office, casting a "warmness" that was irresistable.

I'm also going to guess that you can't remember the specific details about a particular project they worked on, and if you can, I imagine it's because you worked closely on that project with them. If neither of those things are true, my last guess is that anyone who reads this and thinks of a person, you're the person that comes to mind for other people. It's likely that it's because you care deeply about people and their success which leads to knowing those kinds of details.

We love to work with people who put other people first. Not just people who put others before themselves, but leaders who put people before _the work_, before the process...before the politics.

I overheard a conversation a few weeks ago at work where someone belittled their co-worker in an openspace about some bit of work that wasn't complete. The tone of the belittler was devoid of compassion or empathy. It was a binary tone: "Is it done or is it not?"

At the time, I was furious because I knew the work had been done, but it was blocked by something beyond that team's control and they were working to fix it.

Today, I can't remember for the life of me what the specific work was but I remember very clearly the attitude of the work first leader and the attitude of the people first leader.

I remember thinking, "There's one person in that conversation I would love to work with down the road, and it wasn't the one who cared so much about the work that the people came second." (There's a hint of irony there because I care deeply about my work)

For me, what was interesting was realizing that there was a season in the not so distant past at Zappos where I forgot to put people first. I was churning out work. From the top, there were a lot of people grateful for what I was doing, but I was doing it at the expense of my teammates; at the expense of both their self-esteem and their growth.

**An exceptional leader will put people first: above themselves, above the work, above the process, above the politics.**

Chase the exceptional.
