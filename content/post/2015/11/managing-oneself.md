I just read another article where someone questioned the decision to have "no managers" at Zappos.

While it's true that there are no managers by title, there are now _only_ managers by responsibility. Everyone at Zappos is now expected to manage themselves.

The biggest hurdle _won't_ be the removal of managers, it'll be the non-existent frameworks for equipping people to manage themselves.
