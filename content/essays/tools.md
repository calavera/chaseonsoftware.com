The best tools get out of the way so you can do your best work.

It's pretty common in the software field for newcomers to ask: "What's the best tool for _X_?"

I could easily rattle off the list of tools I use for each "X" in my day-to-day, but that doesn't help someone understand _why_ it's the best tool for me, nor does it answer the _real_ question, which is: "What's the best tool for _X_ for *me*?".

The best tools:

- get the job done.
- are easy _for the user_ to learn. (I have one exception to this principle: vim)
- can be customized to your workflow.
- can be automated.
- integrate with other tools. 

## Picking Tools For Yourself

### Getting the Job Done

#### Red Flags 

A tool doesn't meet this criteria if:

- you have to use another tool to capture the work.
- 

## Picking Tools For Others

There may come a time when you'll receive the special gift of picking a tool to help other people do their work. This is a heavy responsibility: your decisions now impacts others.

A few examples of this would be:

- Issue Tracking Systems
- Documentation and Collaboration Software
- Project Management Software
- Continuous Integration / Delivery Tools (this is the dream)

When you've found yourself in this role, there are some really important guiding principles to making a decision that helps your customers (consumers, most likely co-workers, of the tools you pick) be happy and successful. 

### Guiding Principles for Picking Tools for Teams

#### It Should Help The Team First

This may seem like a no-brainer, but I've seen executives and internal tool maintainers pick tools because it made _their_ jobs easier, even if it added process to the downstream consumers. Sadly, when decisions are made this way, the reasons for picking tools (better high level visibility) are sacrificed by those who are supposed to use the tool so they can move faster.
