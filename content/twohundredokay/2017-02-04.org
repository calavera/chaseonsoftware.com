* [[https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2324][RFC 2324: The Hyper Text Coffee Pot Control Protocol]] 

On April 1st 1998 the Network Working Group released a protocol as a joke for controlling coffee pots. It included a =BREW= method, a status code for teapots to respond with "I'm a teapot" and an =Accept-Additions= header field such as =milk-type=, =syrup-type=, =alcohol-type= and =spice-type=. 

Don't forget the Security Considerations: *Anyone who gets in between me and my morning coffee should be insecure.*

I use =$GOOS= and =$GOARCH= currently to build a custom hugo binary to deploy my site so I can publish with Org content rather than Markdown. I only need two: 

- OSX (local dev on multiple machines): =$GOOS=darwin= and =$GOARCH=386=
- Linux (CI/CD in gitlab and netlify): =$GOOS=linux= and =$GOARCH=386=

Just a reminder as I'm writing =org= files with source blocks, it has replaced support for =sh= with =shell=.
