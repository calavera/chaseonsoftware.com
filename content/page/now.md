I'm currently in Las Vegas, Nevada, focusing on these things:

- Growing into the person God has called me to be and Christ allows me to grow into
- Enjoying the riches of being a husband 
- Enjoying the riches of being a dad
- spoiling our two dogs
- Solving technical problems and enhancing distributed culture at Walmart Labs
- Reading books
- Writing about growth, essential productivity, distributed work and software
- Automating what I can so I can do what I should

**Right now, these are the themes I'm focusing on.**

People ask me to do other things. I want them to be successful in their endeavours, but I say no to everything else so I can say yes to this list.

**If anything changes, I'll update this page.**
