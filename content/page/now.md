I'm currently in Las Vegas, Nevada, focusing on these things:

- Growing into the person God has called me to be and Christ allows me to grow into
- Enjoying the riches of being a husband and spoiling our two dogs
- Working with high school kids at our Church's youth group
- Solving problems around continuous integration and delivery for Walmart Labs
- Reading books
- Writing about growth as an individual and software developer

**Right now, these are the themes I'm focusing on.**

People ask me to do other things. I want them to be successful in their endeavours, but I say no to everything else so I can say yes to this list.

**If anything changes, I'll update this page.**
