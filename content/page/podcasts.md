I'm a big fan of podcasts. They're useful for pretty much any occasion when I need to do multi-taskable tasks that don't require my ears: walking the dogs, eating/cooking meals, driving. 

This list is a great, big round-up of all my favorite podcasts with a note about what it is and a few episodes for each that I think make great "gateway" episodes.  

## A Note

I realized recently that podcasts can be bucketed into two styles:

- **conversational.** Listening to these types of podcasts make you feel like you're hanging out drinking coffee with the host(s) and guest(s). This type of podcast often has a loose theme for each episode, but will take lots of detours and cold leave people who want "takeaways" wanting more. **I enjoy these podcasts the best because they _feel_ authentic and that's a major quality I look for in podcasts.**
- **produced/information saturation.** I have to admit: **It's hard for me to get into these kinds of podcasts.** If you've ever listened to an NPR show, you know what I'm talking about, this type of podcasts, although intentional (often to a fault, imo) feels sterile and over produced. The big advantage with these kinds of podcasts is that there is little to no cruft. **Every word or phrase has been chosen to give you bang for your buck.**

Sure, you can have podcasts that fall in the middle (there aren't any on this list that are strictly conversational or produced), but it's easy to figure out which bucket these fall into within the first 30 seconds of airtime.

The style is important to me because depending on the situation (if I'm able to be more engaged, for example), I like to listen to different types. If I know a podcast is spewing information I want to jot down, I won't listen to it in the car or while walking the dogs.

I've marked each podcast with the bucket I feel they fall under, not to deter people who prefer one style over the other, but to set expectations about what a listener can expect from the podcast.

## Software Engineering

It probably comes as no surprise that the majority of the podcasts I listen to are technical in nature, but don't be fooled: these podcasts are excellent resources for anyone looking to grow as a software engineer. You'll hear lots of buzzwords or even words that are general technology terms that can help you start a journey of exploration, words you may not have heard in your circles or found on your own.
Beyond the technical aspect of these podcasts, most of them address the human/personal aspects of what it is to be a software engineer. It could range from maintaining open source (Request For Commits is dedicated to that topic), what steps others are taking to grow in the soft skills of software engineering or even just what kinds of interesting non-technical things people are finding (Javascript Jabber and Ruby Rogues both have a "picks" section at the end that is almost always non-technical picks).

## Personal Growth, Productivity & Leadership

These three topics are a big ole ball of yarn, even though they're seemingly different, I've found that they're all separate circles of a vinn diagram.

I bucket minimalism in with productivity in with leadership because they amplify each other when taken in equal parts.

## Interesting People & Random Stuff

Sometimes I like to just listen to podcasts that have nothing to do with anything that immediately touches my edge nodes of life. I like listening to other people talk about aspects of life that I'm unfamiliar with, that I'd like to know more about or that I think just sounds interesting and that's as far as it goes.
