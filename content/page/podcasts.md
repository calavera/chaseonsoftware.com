I'm a huge fan of Podcasts. I listen to them when I walk the dogs. When I walk. When I do chores. They're a big part of my personal growth and helping me keep up to date in the subjects I care about. 

This is an exhaustive, living, breathing list of podcasts I listen to. It's organized by general subjects first and then the "feels" I have for it.
