Whether you need to focus at work, when pursuing your side hustle or studying for school, I'll bet you're listening to music. 

The _right_ music can have an amazing impact on your ability to achieve deep focus. The _wrong_ music can be a major stumbling block to focus and even potentially derail you altogether from completing (or worse, doing) whatever it was you set out to do. 

Music for Focus is a single point of entry where I'm curating a mega-list of the artists, albums and songs that have helped me achieve focus and dial in my productivity.

I'll be posting new playlists every Tuesday and they'll all aggregate into a [larger playlist on Spotify if you're interested in subscribing to it](https://open.spotify.com/user/realchaseadams/playlist/78D3okwJ3NjK7dUIndIS8Q). 

## Oblivion - Soundtrack (01-03-2017)

<img src="/img/focus-music/oblivion-soundtrack.jpg" width=200 class="align-left" /> It likely comes as no surprise to those who I share musical interests with that the inception of such a list would start with M83, one of my favorite artists.

If you're familiar with the artist M83 (you've probably heard some of his songs in commercials), then this album is going to be a major deviation from what you're used to. If you're not familiar with M83, then you're in for a major treat. 

I find myself listening to this soundtrack at least once a week and some days I'll binge on it and just put it on repeat. 

One of my favorite things about it is that the pace is a consistent and easy to keep up with, keeping me engaged with my tasks. If you stick with it, the last track of the album acts as a sort of "treat", as if M83 was waiting the whole time to unleash his familiar epic electronics backing the smooth vocals of Susanne Sundf√∏r.

* when you're listening to music for fun, you should check out one of M83's other albums
* if you haven't seen Oblivion the movie, it's a pretty good post-apocalyptic scifi with some surpises!
