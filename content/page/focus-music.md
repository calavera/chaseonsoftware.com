If you have the luxury of listening to music when you need to focus (at work, at home when pursuing your side hustle or studying for school), you know the impact the right music can have on your ability to achieve deep focus. On the other hand, you also probably know that the _wrong_ music can be a major stumbling block to focus and potentially even deter you altogether from actually doing whatever it was you set out to do. 

I'm a self-professed audiophile, especially when it comes to finding and curating music to act as the soundtrack to my focus and productivity. Music for Focus is a single point of entry for you to enjoy the music I'm listening to and hopefully find some new artists, albums and songs that you can add to your arsenal for when you want to achieve focus.

# Oblivion - Soundtrack

If you're familiar with the artist M83 (you've probably heard some of his songs in commercials), then this album is going to be a major deviation from what you're used to. If you're not familiar with M83, then you're in for a major treat. I find myself listening to this soundtrack at least once a week and some days I'll binge on it and just put it on repeat. One of my favorite things about it is that the pace is a consistent and easy to keep up with, keeping me engaged with my tasks. If you stick with it, the last track of the album acts as a sort of "treat", as if M83 was waiting the whole time to unleash his familiar epic electronics backing the smooth vocals of Susanne Sundf√∏r.

* when you're listening to music for fun, you should check out one of M83's other albums
* if you haven't seen Oblivion the movie, it's a pretty good post-apocalyptic scifi with some surpises!
