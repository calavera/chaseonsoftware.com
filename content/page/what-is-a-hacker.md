__And I want to challenge your paradigm of what it means for someone [to be a hacker](#toc_0).__

When you hear the word _hacker_, you probably immediately think of some dude  with a neck beard and thick glasses sitting in a dark room, munching away at [hot cheetos and takis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YLy4j8EZIk) and drinking [SURGE](https://www.facebook.com/surgemovement), trying to steal people's passwords and credit card numbers so he can pay for his XBox Live Membership.

Or [the group called Anonymous](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_\(group\) wearing [Guy Fawkes Masks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_Fawkes).

Unfortunately, as with all _good_ things, the negative definitions are the commonly accepted ones, but there's a better, more interesting (and exciting) definition of what it means to be a hacker.

## So what is a hacker?

A hacker is __simply someone who enjoys growing their abilities and skillsets by creating or building creative, and often unconventional, solutions to interesting problems, along with the satisfaction of the intellectual stimulation that comes with it.__

### Hacking is about Solving Interesting Problems

Everyone has something they're interested in, which means everyone can be a hacker. The first component of being a hacker is having something you love to do, because _everything_ has problems.

There are no perfect systems and because there are no perfect systems, that means there will always be interesting problems that need solving. It also means there's always a better way to solve problems.

### Hacking is about Growing

Being a hacker is as much about the implications of personal growth as it is about solving problems.


### Hacking is about Exploring

Exploring is a consequential effect of hacking.

When you want to solve a problem, and the domain of that problem has information either relevant to you getting to a point where you can solve a problem, you have to explore to figure out what you need to know and the information itself.

### Hacking isn't just about Technology

There are [productivity hackers](http://www.skillshare.com/classes/design/Get-Stuff-Done-Like-A-Boss-Design-Your-Workflow-and-Double-Your-Productivity-in-21-Days/1524940083/dashboard?via=dashboard-following), [life hackers](http://lifehacker.com/), [body hackers](http://www.buzzfeed.com/readcommentbackwards/18-amazing-body-hacks-that-will-improve-your-life-dmjk), [food hackers](http://www.foodhack.nl/overview/), [business hackers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkDaJwat6ic) and [coffee hackers](https://www.bulletproofexec.com/bulletproof-coffee-recipe/).

### It's not Just Dudes and Neck Beards

Being a hacker is an equal opportunity, non-discriminant title: There are [women hackers](http://hello.noopkat.com/), like [Hilary Mason](http://www.hilarymason.com/about/), [13 year old hackers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h11u3vtcpaY) and [hacker schools](https://www.hackerschool.com/).

## My Hacker Guide To Becoming A Hacker

Becoming a hacker, in my opinion, is as easy or as difficult as you want to make it, but the key is _you_.

Here are the steps I'd go through to get started:

1. Figure out something you _really enjoy_ geeking out about. You don't have to know a lot about it or be good at it, just something you like.
1. Spend a month learning as much as you can about it.
1. Start building/creating something simple.

## What I Hack On

I'm really into Software, Productivity, Systems & Neural Hacking. I enjoy the satisfaction of trying to solve a problem; having a puzzle to solve and figuring out the steps to get there.
