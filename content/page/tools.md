"What do you use for _____?" Fill in the blank with pretty much everything I do in my daily life and that's a question that I get asked a lot. I decided that rather than ramble about why I like _x_ for _y_, it'd be more pragmatic and useful to create a collection of all of the tools I use to be more effective, to be more prepare or to enhance the already rich parts of my life.

This page will continue to grow and shrink as I add, remove and rotate tools out of my workflows and daily life.

#### Why I like it

- the slimmest profile wallet I've ever owned
- a separate slot for cash
- a pull that makes it easy to access the cards that you use frequently (like your Grouchy John's stamp card, credit card and ID)

## Personal 

### Acer C720 Chromebook

I bought this laptop because it was cheap (less than $300), had plenty of processing power for the text editing and "light" software I work on and the BiOS could be flashed so that I could install my operating system of choice on it, rather than being tied to ChromeOS.
