#+DRAFT: true


* Introduction
* Determine your org version
* Tangle single file from single org file
* Tangle multiple files from single org file
* Differences between Org version 8 and Org version 9

Org version 8:

#+BEGIN_SRC  
* .bash_profile
:PROPERTIES:
:tangle: ~/.bash_profile
:END:
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC 
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
echo "hello world"
#+END_SRC
#+END_SRC

One of my favorite features of Emacs is =org-mode= and my favorite feature of =org-mode= is the ability to use literate programming, especially for my dotfiles.

In this article, you'll learn how to tangle multiple files from a single =org= file with version 9 of =org=. My dotfiles live in =~/src/gitlab.com/chaseadamsio/dotfiles= and I'm going to be working out of a file called =shell.org=.





I've been using Emacs' =org-mode= to tangle my dotfiles and found that between version 8 & 9 there were some significant updates that caused my files not to tangle. 

In Emacs, to determine your =org= version, run =execute-extended-command= by typing =M-x= and typing =org-version=. If you're on version 9, you should get a response like the following:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Org mode version 9.0.4 ...
#+END_EXAMPLE




Hopefully this helps someone else out there who was confused by this update!
