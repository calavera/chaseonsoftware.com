This week, I received the book [Site Reliabilty Engineering: How Google Runs Production Systems](https://www.amazon.com/Site-Reliability-Engineering-Production-Systems/dp/149192912X) from Amazon and shared a tweet thanking Tim O'Brien for his recommendation.

Later on in the evening, I received a tweet from Tim:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The fact that <a href="https://twitter.com/chaseadamsio">@chaseadamsio</a>, a programmer, still reads dead-tree books with a highlighter? This gives me faith in humanity.</p>&mdash; Tim O&#39;Brien (@tobrien) <a href="https://twitter.com/tobrien/status/756500702772330496">July 22, 2016</a></blockquote>

I've shared with a few people that I have a very specific set of "rules" for what format I receive books, but I've never actually written it down...so here we go!

There are 3 formats:

- Paperback/Hardcover (physical visual)
- Kindle/eBook (digital visual)
- Audible/audiobook (digital auditory)

I've found that it's best to pick each format based on the type of book I want to read and how focused I want to be when I consume it. 

## Paperback/Hardcover Books (Physical)

- **Pros:** easy highlighting, easy bookmarking, consistent formatting, easy sharing
- **Cons:** physical nature makes it harder to carry more than a few and requires physical storage space

**Types:** technical in nature, "evergreen" personal growth, "essentials list" books

## Kindle / eBook

- **Pros:** portable, scalable, highlighting saved online, instant gratification on purchase
- **Cons:** dependency on device battery life, limited consistent formatting, harder to search than paperback

**Types:** personal growth, business, fiction

## Audible / Audio Books

- **Pros:** portable, scalable, passive, multi-taskable
- **Cons:** dependency on device battery life, highlighting non-existent or kludgy, hard to focus, impossible to "search" for keywords or quotes

**Types:** fiction, non-fiction requiring no action

Almost exclusively fiction. The only time I generally listen to Audio Books are when I'm doing something else that requires attention but also may need some release valve. Currently, driving long distances (anything more than 20 minutes) or walking the dogs are the two times I'd listen to audio books. I can listen to a fiction and pay attention while also tending to the other task I'm doing without feeling the need to concentrate or worse, hearing something I want to highlight or write down because it resonated with me.
