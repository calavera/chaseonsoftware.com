title = "Remote is Dead. Long Live Distributed."
description = "The term 'remote' focuses on where the team member is. It doesnâ€™t address what needs to be done or how to do it. The where is totally irrelevant to the work. The term 'distributed', however, naturally lends itself to thinking about what needs to be done and how we go about doing it together. I am not a remote worker, I am a part of a distributed team."
